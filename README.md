# TRMRS

Pronounced _Tremors_ ðŸª±

This is a small prototype [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) firmware for the [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) device. It's nowhere near the capability of the [official firmware](https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware).

It's based on [esp-rs/esp-idf-template](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template).

You can press the button to alternate between displaying random noise and displaying an image.
